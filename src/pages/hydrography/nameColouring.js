/**
 * Which reaches carry a river name, and what colour that makes them.
 *
 * `network_data/river_names.csv` in the hydrography repo names rivers by the riverId of the reach
 * each name ends on. The rule it encodes is that a name covers everything upstream of that reach,
 * and a tributary named further up overwrites it there — so the name on a reach is the one from the
 * *smallest* named span containing it, and it reads as "the name of the exact segment you clicked,
 * or you are in an unnamed tributary of that name".
 *
 * Everything upstream of a reach is one contiguous run of riverIndex (the same fact the watershed
 * selector is built on), and riverIndex is unique across the whole network, so all of that reduces
 * to intervals on one global axis. `extras_river_name_ranges.py` flattens them to disjoint runs and
 * resolves the colours — which depend on the arrangement, not on the river, since two spans that
 * touch must not share one. What arrives here is the answer, not the inputs to it: a sorted list of
 * boundaries and the palette slot in force after each.
 *
 * It is **fetched from group=0, beside the tiles**, not bundled. The spans are riverIndex values,
 * which mean nothing except against the exact network `streams.pmtiles` was cut from — so the two
 * have to travel together. A copy compiled into this app would keep painting confidently after the
 * network was rebuilt underneath it, pointing at reach numbers that had moved. It is also small and
 * regenerated whenever a name is added, so a fetch is the cheap half of that trade. The fetch and
 * the copy kept on the device belong to riverNamesData.js, which the search box reads too.
 *
 * The colours live here, not in the file. What arrives from the generator is a slot number per
 * river; what a slot looks like is this app's business, which is what lets the palette be redrawn
 * without regenerating anything.

 *
 * Slot 3 is a near-white. It measures 1.24:1 against a light basemap and 1.20:1 against the dark one
 * the app opens on, where unnamed water sits at 3.09:1 — so a river painted in it reads as less
