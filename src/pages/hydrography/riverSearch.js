/**
 * TWIN FILE: webapp-rfs-v3/src/ui/riverSearch.js — the same dialog, doing the same two searches
 * over the same two datasets. That app runs its text through i18n and this one has none, so the
 * strings are inline here; everything else should stay in step.
 *
 * Find a reach by name, or by ID — two boxes, because they are two different questions.
 *
 * They are kept apart rather than merged into one field that guesses from what was typed, because
 * almost nothing about them is the same. A name is answered from a ~100 kB table the app keeps on
 * the device, matches loosely, can return a dozen rivers, and needs a list to choose from. An ID is
 * exact, returns one reach or none, and has to be resolved against the riverId axis — a one-time
 * ~17 MB download on a device without the lookup. One box would have to be a name box that
 * sometimes takes 17 MB, with a results list that sometimes appears, under a label that could only
 * describe both vaguely.
 *
 * The split is also what lets each say the right thing when it fails: "no named river matches that"
 * and "no river has that ID" are different answers, and neither belongs under the other's box. So
 * each half has its own status line.
 *
 * Only the name box is worth typing into as you go — its answers are already on the device, and
 * every row carries the span of riverIndex the river covers, so a name hit needs no lookup at all.
 *
 * onFound(reach, named) hands the result on. `reach` is the reach and nothing else — riverId,
 * riverIndex, upstreamCount, and where it is — in the shape a map click would have produced, since
 * that is what the selection is built from. `named` is only sent for a river found by name: its
 * `span` is the whole named river to select, and `bbox` is what the camera frames instead of the
 * mouth.
 *
 * onClear() takes the selection back off. It needs asking for: the selection deliberately outlives
 * this dialog, which is the point of making one, so nothing else is going to notice the user is
 * done with it.
