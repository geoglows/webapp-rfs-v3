/**
 * IndexedDB storage for the riverId -> riverIndex lookup. Shared by the worker that builds it and
 * the main thread that reads it.
 *
 * The keys and SCHEMA_VERSION below are what let this build read the 17 MB a device already has —
 * see db.js — so they are a contract, not a private detail.
 *
 * The whole lookup is ONE record holding two ArrayBuffers. Storing a row per river instead would
 * mean millions of keyed writes — minutes of work, and a read that costs more than refetching the
 * network. As one record it is a single structured clone in each direction.
 *
 * That clone is ~55 MB, so a second, tiny record shadows it: the same descriptive fields without
 * the buffers. Anything that only needs to know whether a lookup exists and how big it is — the
 * Settings rows, the search box on open — reads that one instead of deserializing the arrays.
 *
 * The connection belongs to data/db.js; this file owns only the two records it keeps in the shared
 * store and what makes one of them usable.
