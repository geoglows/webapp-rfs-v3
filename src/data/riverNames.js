/**
 * TWIN FILE: webapp-rfs-hydrography/src/riverNamesData.js — the same module under a name that does
 * not collide with the explorer's own riverNames.js, which is the colouring it paints from.
 *
 * The river names, from the app side: keep a copy on the device, keep it current, and search it.
 *
 * `group=0/riverNames.json` is a hand curated table of the rivers people actually look for — a few
 * hundred of them, each stored as the span of the network it covers rather than as a name on every
 * reach. It is published beside the tiles because those spans are `riverIndex` values, which mean
 * nothing except against the exact network release they were compiled from.
 *
 * That span is also why searching by name is cheap in a way searching by ID is not. A name row
 * already carries `hi`, the mouth reach's own `riverIndex`, and `riverIndex` is what every reader
 * in this app takes. So a name found here is a river the charts can open immediately — no binary
 * search, and none of the ~17 MB riverId lookup that a bare ID has to be resolved through. The
 * whole names table is ~100 kB.
 *
 * Names are not unique and cannot be made to be. There are two Severns, in Britain and in Ontario,
 * and three rivers called Verde; the watershed alone does not separate them, because two of those
 * collisions are between watersheds that also share a name. Every row therefore carries the
 * country its mouth stands in, the named river it flows into if there is one, and its geographic
 * extent — which is what a results list needs to tell two rows apart, and what the camera needs to
 * frame the river rather than drop a pin on its mouth.
