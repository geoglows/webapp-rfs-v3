 * TWIN FILE: webapp-rfs-hydrography/src/riverLocation.js — the same module, keep the two in step.
 *
 * Where a reach is, by riverIndex: `{lat, lon, upstreamCount}` read straight off the hydrography
 * metadata store.
 *
 * The point is the reach's downstream end, which is what the saved rivers in src/constants.js were
 * baked from — so a searched river and a saved one send the camera to the same kind of place.
 *
 * Three chunk reads, ~40 KB each, and no artifact to build or keep: the arrays sit on the same axis
 * as the riverIds, so an index is all it takes to read one. That is why this is looked up when a
 * reach needs it rather than downloaded up front like the id lookup next door — one reach costs a
 * fraction of a percent of what the whole axis would.
 *
 * `upstreamCount` rides along for the explorer, whose selection is the run of riverIndex above the
 * reach and cannot be built without it. This app ignores it. One read either way.
