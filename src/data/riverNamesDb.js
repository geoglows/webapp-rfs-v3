/**
 * IndexedDB storage for the river names table, and the clock it expires on.
 *
 * TWIN FILE: webapp-rfs-hydrography/src/riverNamesDb.js. Both apps read this record out of the same
 * database, so the keys and SCHEMA_VERSION below are a contract between them, not a private detail.
 *
 * Small enough — a few hundred rows — to be one record holding a plain array, so unlike the river
 * ID lookup there is nothing to gain from a typed-array layout and nothing expensive about reading
 * it. It still gets the same shadow meta record, for the same reason: the Settings row and the
 * freshness check want to know what is held and when it was fetched without pulling the rows.
 *
 * Both records go in the shared store from data/db.js under keys of their own — a store per dataset
 * would mean an upgrade, and see that file for why an upgrade is not worth what it can cost.
 *
 * The names are the one dataset here with no publishing schedule behind it. They are hand curated
 * upstream and republished whenever edits have accumulated, which may be twice in a week or not
 * for months, so there is no update time to wait for and no version to watch. What replaces that
 * is a clock the client keeps on its own: a copy is good until the next 5th of the month at 00:00
 * UTC, and after that it is revalidated. The 5th is not arbitrary — it is the boundary the monthly
 * retrospective products already publish on, so a device that wakes up to refresh one is refreshing
 * both.
 *
 * Expiry is not invalidation. An expired copy is still shown while the revalidation runs, and a
 * server that answers "not modified" only moves the date forward — the rows never leave, so name
 * search does not stop working on the 5th of the month or on a device that is offline that day.
